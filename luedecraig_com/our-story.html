                <h2>Virginia Craig</h2>
                <p>
                    Virginia was born in Tulsa Oklahoma on February 19th, 1993 to Paul and Vicki Craig. Their family of 4 (including a 3 year old Heather) moved out to Colorado when Virginia was about 6 months old. By the time she was 1 year old they had moved into the house they still call home today. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virginia attended The Academy, a K-12 charter school, from grades 3 to 12. She made many strong friendships there that still impact her today. After graduating from the Academy she went on to attend Colorado State University and majored in Accounting while minoring in Criminology and Criminal Justice. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While starting her sophomore year at CSU and looking for a job, she ended up getting hired at a restaurant in Loveland called Wing Shack. She had no idea how integral this job would be to her future (both professionally and romantically). She worked her way up through college and as a shift leader during her senior year decided to pursue management with Wing Shack after she graduated (she was not keen on becoming a CPA.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After bouncing between the Windsor and Loveland locations a bit, she became the General Manager of the Loveland Wing Shack. Shortly after she became general manager, one of her operations managers, Jessica, decided to play matchmaker with Virginia and a guy who worked in the same building and ate at Wing Shack regularly. He had mentioned his interest in Virginia to Jessica; and Virginia, being oblivious and a workaholic, needed some neon signs to realize it.

                <h2>Jason Luedeking</h2>
                <p>
                    Jason moved to Colorado by chance. After spending the majority of his adolescent and adult life in Las Vegas, he grew tired of the imported palm trees and casino lined horizon. He put together a list of several cities that he thought would be a great home for the next chapter in his life, and set out to visit them before making his decision. Colorado was the first place that he visited, and after stepping off the plane in Denver - he knew that his search had already ended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the first two weeks after his move, everything fell into place for him. He found an affordable apartment that he could move into almost immediately, and an associate level position at a company nearby working in an industry that he had always wanted to excel in. His mom even surprised him by bringing his childhood cat with her during her first visit, so he had company in this new adventure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jason stayed with that company for several years, and during that time it became common practice for his team to get food from the restaurant next door. One day while ordering, he noticed a new face behind the counter, and everyone just called her "V". Virginia's sarcastic wit was a language that he understood well, and her smile and personality were magnetic. Whenever his team stopped in, they would bounce jokes off one another like seasoned improv comedians. Her boss / great friend Jessica noticed their interactions together, and approached him as a matchmaker. He couldn't lie, he was smitten.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the next few weeks Jessica would invite them both for "beer thursdays'' after work. Virginia was still unsure about dating Jason since he worked right next door and was a regular customer with his coworkers. But with their natural chemistry and comedic banter, he joked that he could always quit his job! After a few weeks of texting and hanging out together, she decided that wouldn't be necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though they didn't have many common interests back then, their sense of humor was so aligned that being around each other was the highlight of their days. Over time they learned to appreciate each other's hobbies and interests, and have embarked on many new adventures together. Jason's cats also made Virginia realize that she is a cat lady rather than a dog lady.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a long weekend working an out-of-state convention alone, Jason returned home at 3:30am Monday morning to find his office decorated with children's birthday balloons. As he stood there grinning away at the ridiculous display, he knew that this was the hilarious weirdo that he wanted to marry. However, with such a big step for their relationship, he did want to rush it. It would take him until the beginning of a world wide pandemic to finally ask -- he's terrible with timing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting engaged the day before a pandemic shut down Northern Colorado was very weird. After two years of delayed plans, Jason and Virginia decided that a backyard wedding would be the best solution for these unpredictable times. Thankfully Virginia's parents are the proud owners of a backyard, and roughly 25 chairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through many discussions, Jason and Virginia have decided to merge their last names to become the Luedecraigs.
