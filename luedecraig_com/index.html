                <h3>Heather Craig</h3>
                <p>Heather is Virginia’s older sister and only sibling. They are less than 3 years apart, so they grew up doing everything together. They share a love of Weird Al, playing games, and uncontrollable sarcasm as instilled in them by their parents.</p>

                <img src="./img/party/sarah.jpg">
                <h3>Sarah Washburne</h3>
                <p>Virginia met Sarah in 7th grade and bonded over making funny videos and running cross country. Through high school they got closer and ended up deciding to attend CSU together. They even lived together for 3 years before they graduated.</p>

                <h3>Dana Weijers</h3>
                <p>Virginia met Dana the first day of freshman year at CSU because they both lived on the same dorm floor. They immediately got along and became part of a large friend group, including Sarah. Virginia also lived with Dana for 2 years prior to moving in with Jason.</p>

                <h3>Brennan McCue</h3>
                <p>Jason met Brennan at one of his first ever conventions. Sitting alone at a booth with no branding, Brennan walked up and sparked one of Jason's closest and most trusted friendships. And without him, the entire grooms party wouldn't be what it is today.</p>

                <img src="./img/party/zavier.jpg">
                <h3>Zavier Bates</h3>
                <p>Zavier also met Jason at a convention, and their first meeting was explosive (Zavier blew everyone up in their game.) Since then, they have had each other's back through thick and thin, and commonly compete for Virginia's friendship.. Jason might be winning.</p>

                <h3>Frank Silva</h3>
                <p>Being such a good soul, becoming great friends with Frank was inevitable. They bonded through being victims of Zavier's first game, and over the years Frank has become the rock of the groomsmen friend group. His unmatched creative talents have also helped Oathen excel.</p>

                <h3>Aaron Tiberius Bonner</h3>
                <p>Jason and Aaron initially started as bitter rivals competing for the same job position - that lasted about five minutes. As soon as their comedic energies aligned, they became the wonder twins of jokes, technical excellece, and slightly illegal mischief.</p>
